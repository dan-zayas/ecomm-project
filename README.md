# Danozaur E-Commerce

Welcome to Danozaur E-Commerce, a clothing sales website that allows users to browse and purchase clothing items. This website has been created as a class project to demonstrate understanding of web design principles.

## Tech Stack

I have used the following technologies and libraries in this project:

- HTML and CSS for the website's structure and styling
- React for building the user interface
- Redux for state management
- Redux-Saga for handling asynchronous actions
- Stripe API for processing user payments
- Firebase API for user authentication and managing user accounts
- GraphQL for querying and managing data
- Jest for testing the application
- Typescript for type checking and adding static types to JavaScript

## CRUD Resources

I have implemented CRUD operations on two resources: the user's cart and user accounts.

The cart can be manipulated by adding or removing items from it, while user accounts can be created, read, updated, and deleted.

## User Authentication

I have implemented user authentication using Firebase. This allows users to create an account, log in, and log out of the website.

## Back-end Models and Database Design

Our back-end models and database design have been created to properly store and organize user data.

I have created entities for users, items, and carts. Each user can have multiple items in their cart, and each item can belong to multiple carts.

## Styling, Presentation, and Site Navigation

I have implemented proper styling and presentation to ensure that this website is visually appealing and easy to use.

I have also implemented proper site navigation to make it easy for users to browse and purchase clothing items.

## Key Features

Some of the key features that I have implemented in this ecommerce website include:

- User account creation and authentication
- Browse and purchase clothing items
- Add or remove items from the user's cart
- Secure payment processing using Stripe
- User account management
