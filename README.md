# Danozaur E-Commerce

Welcome to Danozaur E-Commerce, a clothing sales website that allows users to browse and purchase clothing items. This website has been created as a class project to demonstrate our understanding of web design principles.

## Tech Stack

We have used the following technologies and libraries in our project:

- HTML and CSS for the website's structure and styling
- React for building the user interface
- Redux for state management
- Redux-Saga for handling asynchronous actions
- Stripe API for processing user payments
- Firebase API for user authentication and managing user accounts
- GraphQL for querying and managing data
- Jest for testing the application
- Typescript for type checking and adding static types to JavaScript

## CRUD Resources

We have implemented CRUD operations on two resources: the user's cart and user accounts.

The cart can be manipulated by adding or removing items from it, while user accounts can be created, read, updated, and deleted.

## User Authentication

We have implemented user authentication using Firebase. This allows users to create an account, log in, and log out of the website.

## Back-end Models and Database Design

Our back-end models and database design have been created to properly store and organize user data.

We have created entities for users, items, and carts. Each user can have multiple items in their cart, and each item can belong to multiple carts.

## Styling, Presentation, and Site Navigation

We have implemented proper styling and presentation to ensure that our website is visually appealing and easy to use.

We have also implemented proper site navigation to make it easy for users to browse and purchase clothing items.

## Key Features

Some of the key features that we have implemented in our ecommerce website include:

- User account creation and authentication
- Browse and purchase clothing items
- Add or remove items from the user's cart
- Secure payment processing using Stripe
- User account management
